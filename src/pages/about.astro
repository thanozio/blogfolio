    <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>
    <p>
      I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second
      page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
    </p>

    <p>
      This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
      back and see how my journey is going!
    </p>

    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
      <li>I live in {identity.country} as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
      <li>
        My hobbies are:
        <ul>
          {identity.hobbies.map((hobby) => <li>{hobby}</li>)}
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>

    {excited && <p>I am excited to be learning Astro!</p>}

    {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

      goal === 3 ? (
        <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p>
      ) : (
        <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>
      )
